# Separate Links for Different Platforms

Certain applications are designed to work only on specific platforms. For instance, an app may function only on mobile
devices due to hardware or interface constraints.

Platformer enables developers to assign distinct URLs for different platforms. If no URL is set for a particular
platform, Platformer automatically displays a placeholder to inform users that the app cannot run on their current
device.
