# Ecosystem

**Platformer is not just an infrastructure project. It is a cohesive, self-contained ecosystem capable of uniting
fragmented mini-app platforms into a single space.**

In today’s world, mini-apps are becoming a universal interface for user interaction. Telegram Mini Apps, VK Mini Apps,
LINE, WeChat—each of these platforms has its own unique potential. However, developers are forced to repeat the same
steps over and over for each one.

**Platformer changes that.** By creating a mini-app within Platformer, you automatically gain the ability to launch it
across all supported platforms where our launcher is available. Of course, no app becomes accessible without your
permission—you remain in full control.

The main advantage of Platformer lies in its cross-platform nature. All tools, interfaces, and capabilities are unified,
regardless of where your app is launched. This not only simplifies development and maintenance but also lets you focus
on what matters most—creating value for users.

**With Platformer, you no longer need to reinvent the wheel for every new platform.** You get centralized management, a
unified API, and consistently high quality across all distribution channels. And if a platform doesn’t provide the
necessary tools—Platformer fills that gap.

**One ecosystem. All platforms. Maximum freedom for developers.**
