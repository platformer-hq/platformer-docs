# General Information

Launchers are autonomous open-source web applications that allow Platformer to correctly display and handle mini-apps
within the context of a specific platform. Each launcher is carefully adapted to the characteristics of its target
environment.

The launcher acts as a bridge between the native client and the developer's application. It doesn’t just render the
interface—it also handles technical tasks specific to the platform, freeing the developer from dealing with them
manually.

Additionally, launchers implement unique features specific to Platformer, some of which have not yet been publicly
announced.
