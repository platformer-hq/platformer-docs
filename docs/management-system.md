# Management System

Modern mini-app development is rarely a solo endeavor. More often, a team is involved—developers, QA specialists,
managers, designers, and others. And as soon as the project moves beyond the prototype stage, one question arises: **how
do you effectively manage access, roles, and responsibilities within the team?**

**Platformer provides a flexible and convenient management system** that accounts for the specifics of collaborative
work and enables a process that’s as transparent and secure as possible.

## User Roles

Each mini-app includes three types of roles:

* **Owner** — has full control over the app. Only the owner can delete the app or transfer ownership to another user.
* **Administrator** — has editing rights. Can modify app information and settings.
* **Member** — has view-only access. Ideal for observers, consultants, or team members who don’t need editing
  permissions.

## Invitations and Access

Once you’ve created a mini-app, you can invite other users to manage it with you. But there’s an important rule:
**you can only invite users who have explicitly allowed this in their settings**.

By default, all users are hidden from invitations—this prevents spam and unwanted notifications. To allow invitations, a
user must go to the **“Privacy and Security”** section and enable the **“Allow App Management”** option.

Invitations are sent through the management interface in the **“Managers”** section. Once sent, the invited user will
see a notification in their admin panel under **“Management Invitations”**, where they can accept or decline.

After accepting, the user officially becomes part of the app’s management team, with the role you assigned.

## Access Details

It’s important to note: **managers are not restricted by the app’s privacy level**. They always have access to the
mini-app, even if it’s hidden from other users. Visibility for managers is determined either
via [test groups](./test-groups.md) or [customized links](./separate-links.md).
