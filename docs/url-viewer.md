# URL Viewer

**Platformer is a flexible and intelligent system** that selects the mini-app link based on multiple factors:

* [Privacy level](./privacy-levels.md),
* [User role](./management-system.md) (e.g., whether the user is a manager),
* Membership in a [test group](./test-groups.md),
* The platform and client being used, and other conditions.

This flexibility is powerful—but it can raise the question:
**what exact link will a specific user see in a specific context?**

To eliminate guesswork and avoid manually dissecting the display logic, **Platformer offers a simple yet powerful
tool—the URL Viewer**.

You’ll find it in the information section of your mini-app. With it, you can:

* Select any user,
* Get a precise answer: **what link will be shown on a specific platform, and why.**

The tool not only displays the final link but also **explains the selection logic**—why that link was chosen, what
priority was applied, and which rules were involved.
