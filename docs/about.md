# Platformer

*Platformer is a project that creates a fully independent ecosystem of mini-applications across various platforms. It
allows developers to make their mini-apps available on all platforms where Platformer operates. When a mini-app is
created within Platformer, it automatically becomes available on all supported platforms.*

*It is a completely independent and autonomous ecosystem with ambitious long-term plans.*

## Motivation

We live in an era where mini-applications are becoming an important part of the digital experience for millions of
users. However, for developers, creating such solutions across different platforms remains a challenging task—each
environment requires separate setup, maintenance, and constant updates. **Platformer** aims to change this paradigm.

Our goal is to create a unified, powerful ecosystem where developers can launch their mini-apps once—and see them
working everywhere. We are inspired by solutions like [VK Mini Apps](https://dev.vk.com/ru/admin/apps-list), where a
convenient control panel and extensive toolkit truly simplify life for developers. But we are going further: starting
with support for Telegram Mini Apps, we are already laying the foundation to expand to other platforms.

Today, the main entry point for Telegram Mini Apps remains the bot [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather), originally
created for setting up Telegram bots. Despite its effectiveness in that area, working with mini-apps through it is far
from ideal—both in terms of convenience and functionality. This is where the story of Platformer begins.

**Platformer is a response to the growing demand from the developer community.** It offers a simple, intuitive, and
powerful way to work with mini-apps, removing barriers and opening up new possibilities. Moreover, its independence from
Telegram’s internal team makes the project flexible, resilient, and open to development without restrictions.

We are not just solving a technical problem. We are building a future where developing mini-applications is an
inspiring, accessible, and scalable process.
