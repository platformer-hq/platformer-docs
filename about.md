# Platformer

*Platformer is a project that establishes a completely separate ecosystem for mini applications across multiple
platforms. It enables developers to make their mini applications accessible on all platforms where Platformer operates.
When you create a mini app in Platformer, it will automatically become available on all supported platforms.*

*It is a fully independent and self-contained platform with ambitious long-term plans.*

## Introduction

Over time, the Telegram Mini Apps platform has become an integral part of both Telegram and the TON ecosystem. This
technology enables us to integrate web applications directly into Telegram, offering a wide range of Web 2 services,
games, and utilities, along with valuable Web 3 solutions. Additionally, this platform empowers businesses to expand and
enhance their products, ultimately boosting revenue.

However, despite its potential, the Telegram team appears to have limited resources to enhance the platform with
features available on other platforms like VK Mini Apps. This gap in functionality has compelled us, as external
developers, to create our own solutions. The project, detailed in this document, aims to address this gap.

## Motivation

The primary goal of Platformer is to develop a service that replicates the functionality of
the [VK Mini Apps control panel](https://dev.vk.com/ru/admin/apps-list) (login required to view) and makes it available
across all major platforms, enabling access to mini applications. In the MVP stage, the project focuses on supporting
Telegram Mini Apps, with plans to expand to other platforms in the future.

Currently, in Telegram, external developers only have access to [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather), which offers very
limited capabilities. To expand this functionality, we need support from the Telegram team, whose resources are
currently scarce and highly valuable.

To address this issue, we propose to build a project that not only fully replaces @BotFather but also introduces new
platform functionalities for both developers and general users. This will significantly enhance the solutions provided
by Telegram's platform.
